This week was definietly challenging and tested my math skills and understanding of the concepts. Once I understood how to use each section it made it easier to create the codes. I had to read the sections over about two times, but it helped when I did so.

The hard part of this week for me was the objects. I didn't know you had to use an equal sign after the myObj, so every time I created one it didn't work. I went back and watched the video provieded on it and realized that was my problem.
