#### HW-4 Response

This week had a lot of information to take in. It was definitely a lot more challenging than the last few weeks. I referred to the [p5js](https://p5js.org/reference/) referece page every time I needed help, and I was able to figure out what the problem was with the help of it.

I had struggled with placement of lines but referring back to the p5js referece page helped me out a lot. I think with more practice it will become more natural and easier. Im excited to move forward with p5js and create more things with it.
