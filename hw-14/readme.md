This was harder than I thought it was going to be. I had many problems with trying to get my project to work. I was frusturated the entire time and even deleted it because it wasn't working. I think I would've had more fun with this if I could've figured out how the sprites worked. I also tried to add music, but that didn't play when I tried.
