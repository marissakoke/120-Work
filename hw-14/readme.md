This was harder than I thought it was going to be. I had many problems with trying to get my project to work. I was frusturated the entire time and even deleted it because it wasn't working. After getting help from Professor Musick it worked. Having him help me made me understand what I did wrong and how to fix it next time. I am happy with the outcome of this project. I did enjoy this class, and I am glad I was able to experience how challenging coding is and how much time and learning it was.
