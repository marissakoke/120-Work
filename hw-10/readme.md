This week was intersting to me. I like how you are able to use arrays as lists. I think it makes the code more neat and simple. I thought instead of using shapes this week, I would use words since I haven't worked with them in any of my projects yet. I didn't need much help with anything because the videos provided helped me. I enjoyed working with arrays and seeing how they worked.
