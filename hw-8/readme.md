This week was a little challenging for me. I had a difficult time writing the formula for looping a triangle to go across the bottom of the screen for my grass. I didn't put my issue up on the class repo and I probably should have. Instead I made several different shapes and sizes of triangles.
I ended up using a loop for the sun rays which was simple enough. I did enjoy creating the sun, flower, and grass.
