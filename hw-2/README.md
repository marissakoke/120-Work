# Assignment 2

## 1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

 This homework cycle I did the following,

1. Set up my first text document with my command prompt.
2. Set up my text editor, atom, and added the suggested packages and themes.
3. Added a new line within my text editor.
4. Installed GitHub Desktop and set it up.
5. Created a new repository, made commits with GitHub Desktop, made changes and viewed them in GitHub Desktop, committed the changes and new files, and viewed the commit history.

## 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

 Steps I took to complete the assignment were,

 + Followed along with each session from this weeks lesson.
 + Took my time on each section making sure I understood what I was doing/reading.
 + Used the videos posted as a guide.
 + Made sure I understood how GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop works, and how Atom works.

 ## 3. Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you recieve any useful feedback from your classmates?

 The only issue I had was when I was setting up my first text document with my command prompt. I was able to solve this by using a different command to open the text file. I didn't end up posing to the `class repo issue tracker`, [Issues](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding/issues), because I was able to figure it out. Next time I have a issue that I can't figure out, I will look for help from my classmates.

## 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

I understand everything that we have gone over so far. The only thing that I would like to know more about is how all of the packages and themes work.

## 5. What issues did you help your classmates out with this past homework cycle?

I didn't respond to any of my classmates due to there being a lack of questions being posted to the `class repo issue tracker.` I will definietly respond to any of my classmates who need help or have questions.
