For my final project I am thinking of doing a disco background with two people dancing. I am hoping to put music in the background for them to dance to.

I was intriegued with the frames being able to make the cat seem like it was running so that was part of my inspiration. The music part came from one of the final examples that was given. I thought it was intersting you can add music into it.

Problems I will run into is the music. I will probaly have to ask for help with that or use my resources and read on how to do that. Another thing I will have a hard time with is finding a dancing figure to put into the frames.

My work plan will be simple. I will take one day to put all my focus into this final project and make sure everything works as I want it to. I will use this weekend to get the main functions out of the way, then I will use that single day to do the things that I;m not familiar with.
